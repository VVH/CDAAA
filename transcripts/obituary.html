<p><em>Note:</em> This text is an obituary for Hannah Elizabeth Bean (1853-1860) from The Columbia Herald from 
<a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033386/1869-09-17/ed-1/seq-3/">September 17, 1869</a>.</p>

<p>HANNAH ELIZABETH, daughter of Jos.<br />
W. and MARY ANN BEAN, was born Aug. 3,<br />
1853, and died August 22, 1869, aged 16 years<br />
and 19 days.</p>

<p>Death is never so unwelcome a visitor as<br />
when it comes in the morn of life, and takes<br />
from us those buds of promise over which<br />
we have watched so tenderly and hopefully,<br />
and whose beauty and sweetness have not<br />
been marred by the trials and sterner duties<br />
of maturer age. It is the drying up of the<br />
wellspring of affection; the sudden sundering<br />
of the tenderest chords that center in the<br />
heart; the destruction of the sweetest hopes<br />
and fairest anticipations that give charm to<br />
the future. But such are our bereavements<br />
when viewed only in the light of a worldly<br />
philosophy. When consoled by the blessed<br />
promises of religion&mdash;and considered by<br />
the deeper philosophy of the Bible&mdash;despair<br />
is lifted from the heart, our hopes extended<br />
beyond the confines of time, and new<br />
pictures of seraphic joys that never fade are<br />
revealed to us.</p>

<p>The subject of this notice was truly an<br />
interesting and lovely character, and her early<br />
death a bereavement to those who had<br />
nurtured and cherished her from infancy, and<br />
who were expecting so much pleasure from<br />
that maturer womanhood upon which she<br />
would soon have entered. To her parents<br />
she was tender and obedient&mdash;to her teachers<br />
she was considerate and courteous&mdash;to all<br />
she was amiable and affectionate. This life<br />
had its charms for her, but she had learned<br />
to trace all substantial good to her Creator,<br />
and sought so to live as to secure a better<br />
life beyond the grave. To her bereaved<br />
family and sorrowing schoolmates this reflection<br />
should be no less comforting in its influence,<br />
than profitable in its instruction. The living<br />
of to-day are the dead of to-morrow. Let us<br />
so live, then, that death will be but the<br />
beginning of a more blissful life. R,</p>
